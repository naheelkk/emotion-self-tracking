Gentle Tracker (Minimal)

A minimalist, private, single-page web application designed to help you gently track your daily mental weather.

🧠 About

Gentle Tracker provides a quiet, judgment-free space to acknowledge difficult moments (like overthinking, anxiety, or isolation) and moments of self-compassion. The app features a high-contrast, black-and-white theme paired with a subtle, interactive neural network background.
